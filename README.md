TASK DISCRIPTION: In this project we focuses on designing the frontend user interface of an e-learning platform using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. The objective is to create a structured and user-friendly interface that includes course listing, progress tracking, and video embedding features. The platform should visually present available courses, show learners’ progress through indicators such as progress bars, and allow access to video-based learning content. The design must be clean, responsive, and interactive, ensuring smooth navigation across multiple sections or pages. This task demonstrates the ability to design practical, real-world frontend interfaces and apply UI concepts commonly used in modern educational platforms.
